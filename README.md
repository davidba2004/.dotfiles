# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.
## .bin/cleanup.sh
This reverses anything done in the linux.sh script.
## ./bin/linux.sh
This makes a file called .bup_vimrc in my home directory and redirects the contents of .vimrc in my etc directory to a .vimrc file in my home directory.
##./Makefile
This runs the two of the previous files together.
